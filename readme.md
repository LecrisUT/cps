Common Package Specification
============================

This is the repository for the Common Package Specification; a mechanism for
describing a software package such that it may be easily consumed by other
software projects.

The actual specification may be viewed [here](https://cps-org.github.io/cps/),
or by viewing the latest
[source documents](https://github.com/cps-org/cps/).
An example CPS file can be seen
[here](https://github.com/cps-org/cps/blob/master/sample.cps).

If you have [Sphinx](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/) installed, the provided
`Makefile` may also be used to render the latest version of the specification
locally. (Or run `sphinx-build` directly with your favorite options. Note
however that non-HTML output is not tested and may not work.)
