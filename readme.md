Common Package Specification
============================

This is the repository for the Common Package Specification; a mechanism for
describing a software package such that it may be easily consumed by other
software projects.

The actual specification may be viewed [here](https://mwoehlke.github.io/cps/),
or by viewing the latest
[source document](https://github.com/mwoehlke/cps/blob/master/common-package-specification.rst).

If you have [Python](https://www.python.org)
[Docutils](http://docutils.sourceforge.net/) installed, the provided `Makefile`
may also be used to render the latest version of the specification locally. (Or
run `rst2html` directly. No special options are needed; the `Makefile` just
specifies the file names for you.)
